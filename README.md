## Thought Process

While the challenge was originally presented as a fairly straight forward task, I really
wanted to push myself to try to make a small application in React with scalability in
mind. This was my first attempt at really making a single page app with React, and in
doing so I have learned a lot about the framework and I am excited to work on more
projects with it in the future.
